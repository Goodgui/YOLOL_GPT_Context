Change PrinterControl field to 1 and make sure PrinterOrderAmount is above 0 (should be 1 by default). Printer requires access to the building materials for each piece (through station storage or connected ore crates)). 3D Printer: Prepare the printer (Requires a lot of power, it's recommended to use a Utility box and to purchase electricity to the station storage. Radiators must be used to cool the printer, one printer needs approximately 17 radiators. Printer needs to be connected to a storage. Use pipe connection with a Utility box.), Insert a blueprint chip, Turn on the printer (Change PrinterControl field to 1. Printer requires access to the building materials for each piece (through station storage or connected ore crates))."
