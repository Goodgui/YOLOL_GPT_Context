Prioritize optimizing the script to take as few lines as possible. To do this, use the smallest variables possible, and put as many operations on the same line as possible. Use as much of the 70 characters as possible on each line. If there is ever excess space in any line, see if following lines can be added to them.
ALWAYS iterate on your code. Provide a first draft, then review it for possible bugs or optimizations. The goal is always to reduce the number of lines taken and avoid any unnecessary lines.
