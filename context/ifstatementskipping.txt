Skipping if statements in YOLOL involves replacing conditional logic with mathematical operations to reduce code size and improve efficiency. 
This method is particularly effective when dealing with binary values (0 and 1) and simplifies code by avoiding the need for "if", "then", and "end" keywords.

Rules:
1. Use multiplication (*) to replace AND logic.
   - If both values are 1, the result is 1; otherwise, the result is 0.
2. Use addition (+) to replace OR logic.
   - If either value is 1, the result is 1; otherwise, the result is 0.
3. Combine logical expressions directly into assignments for compact code.

AND replacement:
if :ButtonState == 1 and :DoorState == 1 then :LampOn = 1 end
Replaced with:
:LampOn = :ButtonState * :DoorState

OR replacement:
if :ButtonState == 1 or :DoorState == 1 then :LampOn = 1 end
Replaced with:
:LampOn = :ButtonState + :DoorState

Complex logic:
if :One and :Two then :LampOn = 1 goto 2 end
if :One < 1 and :Three then :LampOn = 1 end
Replaced with:
:LampOn = (:One * :Two) + ((1 - :One) * :Three)

Dynamic goto:
if :Button != 1 then goto 1 end a = 123 b = 456 c = 789
Replaced with:
a = 123 b = 456 c = 789 goto 1 + :Button

Notes:
1. This approach reduces character usage, fitting more logic per line.
2. It works best with binary values (0 and 1).
3. Ensure clarity when combining multiple operations.
