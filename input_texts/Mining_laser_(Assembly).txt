}}<section begin=summary/>The mining laser applies continuous damage to the first object hit within its configured range, making it an efficient tool in professional mining, and is often used in conjunction with [[ore collector|ore collectors]].<br>
For example the [[Urchin|mining ship Urchin]] is equipped with mining lasers.<section end=summary/>

== Basic information ==

Mining laser uses a device field to control the length and state of the laser.<br> 
The mining laser is usually connected to a control device such as [[Buttons|buttons]] or [[Levers|levers]].<br>
The mining laser consumes 6000 electricity per second while active.

== Assembly ==

A mining laser needs to be attached to several objects to function:

* [[Utility tool body type 1|Utility Tool Body]] which needs equipped with 2 [[Utility_tool_capacitor|Utility Tool & Rail Cannon Capacitors]]
* A weapon mount: Either a [[Turret_cradle|Turret Cradle]], [[Fixed_mount_small_turntable_2|Small Turntable Mount 2]], or [[Fixed_weapon_mount_2|Fixed Weapon Mount 2]] will work
** Note that the small turntable mount will require a matching [[Turntable|turntable]]
* [[Hardpoints|Device Hardpoint]]

The hardpoint needs connected to power via [[Cable_tool|Cable]] or [[Duct]].
