}}<section begin=summary/>The network relay is a device used to separate a [[Data networks|network]] within a ship or station into multiple partially separate sub-networks. Separate sub-networks allow one-way broadcasting of variable changes between them, and enable the creation of modular [[YOLOL|YOLOL]] systems.<section end=summary/>

== Basic information ==

* Network Relays are connected to two separate [[Data networks|data networks]] via cable sockets at both ends of the device
** One end of the relay acts as the "input" connection
** The other end acts as the "output" connection
** The input / output direction is shown through triangles pointing towards the output side
* When the relay is powered, changes made to device fields connected to the input propagate / will apply to all similarly named device fields that are connected to relay output
** Values between networks are not automatically synchronized
*** This means that connected networks may contain different values for similarly named device fields
* A Network Relay can also not propagate data, by setting MasterIsEnabled or IsEnabled to 0
** MasterIsEnabled can only be influenced from the Input side
** IsEnabled can be influenced from the input side if it is propagating data. If it is 0, it can only be influenced from the Output side.

'''NOTE:''' the Network relay can only function, if there is no open connection between the separate [[Data networks|data networks]], like a different network relay or a direct cable connection.
* Use in conjunction with [[Memory relay|memory relays]] to transfer power and select data
