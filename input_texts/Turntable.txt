<section begin=summary/>Turntables are mounted platforms for devices. Machinery such as [[Mounted weapons|cannons]] and [[Tractor beam (Assembly)|tractor beams]] can be mounted on top of the turntables, which allow the device to rotate around the Y-axis. The mounted machinery must be mounted to a cradle to enable rotation around the X-axis. 
<section end=summary/>
== Basic information ==

A turntable's target rotation can be set with the [[Universal tool|universal tool]], or by connecting it to a control device such as a [[Levers|lever]] or a [[Buttons|button]]. The turntable's turret rotation [[Device fields|device field]] will rotate the turntable to the specified number in degrees, and does not allow relative adjustments (eg: +5 or -5). Each turntable has a base that must be mounted to a device hardpoint, and a rotating piece which can accept a variety of other machinery, such as [[Cradle|cradles]] or weapon mounts. The speed at which a turntable rotates is determined by the mass attached to its rotating surface, and they are too weak to withstand the stress of a thruster. There are also provisions for sockets across turntables, which disallows users from cabling to devices mounted to a turntable. It is important to note that the rotating piece can occasionally rotate 180° on its axis for no reason, so either have safeguard yolol or manually fix it every time. If the ship is powered off while the table is glitched, it will necessitate a complete replacement of the turntable. They cannot be repaired in the field, so it is recommended to either carry spare turntables or the materials to craft them.

== Repairing Tips ==
When repairing turntables it can be tricky.  They are in two parts "turret base turntable" showing in inventories as 'blue beam icon' and another piece "turret turntable".  When repairing you can use the U tool and auto snap both these parts.  Initially when you place the "turret turntable" it will auto snaps into position, you will also need to auto snap the "turret base turntable" separately.  When the the two places are snapped in place you may need to log out to main menu then back again for the game to "rejoin" the two pieces into one.  If you do not do this the turret will not solidify and the item may just fall off.
