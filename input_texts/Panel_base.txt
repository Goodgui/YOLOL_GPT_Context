The panel base provides a convenient way to connect modular devices such as [[Text_panel|text panels]] and [[Buttons|buttons]] to the network, which it itself connects to via the socket on the rear side of the device.

== Basic information ==

Like most devices, panel bases provide a bilateral connection to the network that they are connected to: Data that is received on the modular connection is shared with any device connected to the socket, and vice versa. It is worth noting that panel bases provide a proximal connection with their modular side, and some devices such as [[Progress_bar|progress bars]] do not necessarily need to snapped onto the panel base in order to be 'connected'.
