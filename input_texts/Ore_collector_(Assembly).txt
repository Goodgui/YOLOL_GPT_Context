}}<section begin=summary/>The ore collector functions as an industrial version of the backpack, vacuuming up small ore chunks, it is often used along with [[Mining laser (Assembly)|mining lasers]].<section end=summary/>

== Basic information ==

*The ore collector consumes energy while collecting [[ores|ore]] chunks, equal to the 'power' field.<br>
**At 1000 '''power''' the ore collector collects ore at the rate of 1 mining laser, at 6000 '''power''' it can keep up with 3.5 mining lasers.<br>
*The ore collector must be connected through a [[pipe networks|pipe network]] to [[modular ore cargo crate|modular ore cargo crates]] to function, collected ore is placed into the connected crates.<br>
*The collection area is a 20x5x5m cuboid, extending 20m out in the direction the ore collector points.

== Assembly ==

A ore collector needs to be attached to several objects to function:

* [[Utility tool body type 1|Utility Tool Body]] which needs equipped with 2 [[Utility_tool_capacitor|Utility Tool & Rail Cannon Capacitors]]
* A weapon mount: Either a [[Turret_cradle|Turret Cradle]], [[Fixed_mount_small_turntable_2|Small Turntable Mount 2]], or [[Fixed_weapon_mount_2|Fixed Weapon Mount 2]] will work
** Note that the small turntable mount will require a matching [[Turntable|turntable]]
* [[Hardpoints|Device Hardpoint]]

The hardpoint needs connected to power and your ships network via [[Cable_tool|Cable]] or [[Duct]] to supply power. The hardpoint also needs connection via [[Pipe tool|Pipe]] or [[Duct]] to unfilled [[modular ore cargo crate]]. If you can see your ships inventory while connected via a [[Resource Bridge]] you can right click and delete any ore to make room for the ore collector to collect more ore.
