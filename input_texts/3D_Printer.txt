===Small 3D Printer===

The small 3D printer is a smaller, but slower version of the large printer. It has an integrated utility box and can accept it's own [[fuel rod]], or use power provided from other sources

===3D Printer===

The large 3D printer requires a Utility box to connect to a station's power grid and to access the station inventory for material and to output complete parts.

== How to use ==

=== Small 3D Printer ===
# Insert fuel rod into the printer
# Insert the blueprint chip
#* You can buy these from the Marketplace.
# Turn on the printer
#* Change UtilityConnection field to 1, this is required to allow printer to put finished items into station storage.
#* Change PrinterControl field to 1 and make sure PrinterOrderAmount is above 0 (should be 1 by default).
#* Printer requires access to the building materials for each piece (through station storage or connected ore crates)

=== 3D Printer ===
# Prepare the printer
#* Requires a lot of power, it's recommended to use a Utility box and to purchase electricity to the station storage.
#* Radiators must be used to cool the printer, one printer needs approximately 17 radiators.
#* Printer needs to be connected to a storage. Use pipe connection with a Utility box.

# Insert a blueprint chip

# Turn on the printer
#* Change PrinterControl field to 1.
#* Printer requires access to the building materials for each piece (through station storage or connected ore crates)
