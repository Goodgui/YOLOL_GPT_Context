}}<section begin=summary/>Generators are one of the most essential parts of any constructs that need generated power. Most spaceships for example need to have a properly assembled generator in order for the ships to function. Every machine or device that requires power must be connected to the generator's socket board via a [[Cable tool|cable]], or otherwise to another source of power such as a [[Battery|battery]]. A generator is constructed from many modules, and these modules may be assembled in many different variations. The most basic form of a generator consists of a single generator unit, a fuel chamber, a socket board, and a cooling board with cooling cells.<section end=summary/>

== Basic information ==

Modules can be combined to build a generator for different needs and purposes, with varying shapes, sizes, and efficiency. A generator can be built from the following modules:
* The '''fuel rod''' (This is the container for the the raw fuel that the fuel chamber will process to create energy)
* The '''fuel chamber''' (The fuel rod is placed inside the fuel chamber. The '''raw fuel''' is then processed into '''processed fuel''' in the fuel chamber)
* The '''generator unit''' (Within the generator unit '''processed fuel''' is processed into '''power''')
* The '''cooling board''' (Cooling cells are placed here and '''coolant''' is processed to reduce '''heat''') 
* The '''socket board''' (For attaching cables, one per 100 000 power)
* '''Enhancers''' (For improving efficiency, in three different tiers)


A generator creates its own [[Resource networks|resource network]] within it, which distributes and processes five different resources:
* '''Raw Fuel''' - Stored in the fuel rod.
* '''Processed Fuel''' - Processed in the fuel chamber from '''Raw Fuel'''.
* '''Power''' - Processed in the generator unit from '''Processed Fuel'''.
* '''Heat''' - Produced from the two latter processes, the processing of raw fuel and the processing of power. 
* '''Coolant''' - Stored in the cooling cells. Processed in the cooling board to reduce '''Heat'''.

== Generator Tiers ==

Generate components come in three tiers with differing characteristics:
 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Component !! Tier 1 - Basic !! Tier 2 - Efficient !! Tier 3 - Powerful
|-
| Generator Accent Colour || Blue || Red || Yellow
|-
| Generator Fuel Chamber Rods Used || ''Nhurgite'' Fuel Rods || ''Exorium'' Fuel Rods || ''Exorium'' Fuel Rods
|-
| Generator Fuel Chamber Heat Generated  ||  95 ||  95 || 80
|-
| Generator Unit Electricity Generated per Second || 1000 || 1000 || 1250
|-
| Generator Unit Heat Generated || 100 || 90 || 80
|-
| (raw) Fuel:Energy Ratio || 1:33 || 1:50 || 1:62.5
|-
| (refined) Fuel:Energy Ratio || 1:40 || 1:40 || 1:50
|}

== Heat and cooling ==

Generator units and fuel chambers produce heat while working, which can be cooled passively, by coolant cells or by radiators. The heat produced is directly related to the current unit rate, so at 50 rate the generator unit or fuel chamber produces 50% of the heat. If a generator overheats it will reset it's rate to 0.
