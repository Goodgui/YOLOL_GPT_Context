}}<section begin=summary/>Radiators are very effective options for sustained cooling, but often they require [[heatsink|heatsinks]] to reach their full potential. Each section attached extends the radiator's maximum performance without requiring additional mounting slots. Radiators can be used in conjunction with [[Cooling rack|cooling racks]], but it is not required.<section end=summary/>

== Basic usage ==

* Radiator Bases can be mounted on hardpoints and Radiator Extensions can be mounted to Radiator Bases or other Extensions.
** Radiator Bases have one device interface and two modular output interfaces (where you can connect Radiator Extensions' input interface).
** Radiator Extensions have one input (side with colored bolting spots) and one output interface.
** Both Bases and Extensions can also be mounted on generators, fuelchambers or heatsinks, but that might be unintended behaviour.
* Radiators remove heat transferred to them by heat producers and [[Heatsink|heatsinks]].
** Heat is transferred through pipes or connected devices.
** '''Note:''' Devices have a limit to how much of their heat they can transfer to radiators (default 75, heatsinks 750 - can be added together). See [[Heat_mechanics|heat mechanics]] for in depth info.
