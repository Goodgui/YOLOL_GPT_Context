A radio transmitter is device that exists only on developer stations, it's signals are detectable using [[navigation receivers]]. They are used in [[community navigation systems]]. Radio transmitters can currently not be built by players, all 4 existing ones are developer provided.

== Basic information ==

* Transmitters:
* Have limited range, station transmitters have a maximum range of 1000000, or 1000km
* Sends a message to any receiver, which is in the correct range.
* Does not transmit power, which means receivers must have their own power sources.

== Known station transmitters ==

* All [[Transmitter_Stations|Station transmitters]] broadcast on frequency 1.
* Coordinates for transmitters for the ISAN system can be found [[ISAN#Coordinates|on the ISAN page]].
