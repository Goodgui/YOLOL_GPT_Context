}}<section begin=summary/>The cooling rack is a device used to provide a significant reduction in [[Heat mechanics|heat]] via [[Small cooling cell|coolant]]. Unlike a [[heatsink]] and [[radiator]] system, a coolant rack is not designed for long-term usage, as its coolant is quickly used up during operation and will require replenishing. Thus, some ships use a combination of both systems to cool their [[Generator (Assembly)|generator]].<section end=summary/>

== Basic Usage ==

* The cooling board can hold up to three cooling cells.
* Receives '''Coolant''' from the cooling cells and processes it to reduce '''Heat'''.
** Coolant cells will slowly replenish their supply of fresh coolant over time. However, a [[coolant recharge rack]] can be used to expedite this process.

* The cooling board can be placed anywhere on a generator, and will provide coolant to each generator of the complex it is directly connected to. Generator complexes connected via pipe will not share coolant.
* A single coolant rack can provide up to 5,000 coolant per second (half of the coolant cell's capacity), and can disperse 5 units of heat with 1 unit of coolant. Thus, a coolant rack can disperse up to 25,000 heat per second.
** See [[heat mechanics]] for more info.


* There is only one connector on the cooling board.
