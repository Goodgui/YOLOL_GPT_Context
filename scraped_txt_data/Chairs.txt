Chairs are a type of seat, usually equipped with four legs.<br>
The known universe has a variety of chairs with different functions and designs, such as pilot chairs of spaceships or benches that can usually be found at [[:Category:Stations|space stations]].

== Basic information ==
All chairs and benches can naturally be sit on as that is (usually) their main function.<br>
Within the known universe, pilot chairs, however, also have some specific features. <br>
All pilot chairs are interactable and from them the key binds of the nearby devices can also be customized. <br>

* Pilot seats can be assembled from four pieces [[Bolt tool|bolted]] together, though the seat is functional as a single part:
** Seat
** Stand
** Two sides (arm rests)
