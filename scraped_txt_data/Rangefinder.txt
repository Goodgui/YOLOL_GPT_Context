The range finder is a laser pointer that reports the distance to the object it hits.
If the range finder does not hit anything, it reports the search distance.
The finder can be used on [[Endoskeleton|endoskeletons]] and other objects such as asteroids and ships.

== Basic information ==

'''Range finders can be used to:'''

* Trigger changes when the detected range changes.
* Create balance systems for space ships by comparing ranges on the opposite sides of a ship.
* Hover ship elevation control by comparing a elevation level to a range finder.
* Asteroid AutoAutoavoidance, which detects where an asteroid is located within the rangefinder array and uses simple YOLOL scripts to maneuver the ship out of the path of the asteroid to prevent a collision. These scripts have to be optimized for response time.

'''How to use:'''

* Range finders are bolted to a [[hardpoints|hardpoint]].
* Requires a power source, such as the [[Generator (Assembly)|generator]] via [[Cable tool|cable]] or [[Duct|ducts]].
* Once installed, the measured range can be found from the RangeFinderDistance device field (in metres). It is important to note that the RangeFinderDistance will show the ''maximum'' range (which is the beam length set in RangeFinderSearchLength) if the beam doesn't collide with anything in front of it.

Power consumption when turned on: 1 electricity per second.<br>
