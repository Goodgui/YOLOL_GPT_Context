Thrusters are a mandatory part of spaceships: Not only can a spaceship not move on its own without them, but the game defines a spaceship by their inclusion. Thrusters determine which directions a spaceship can be flown and at what speed, and they require power and propellant to function. Cables and pipes must attach a thrusters [[Hardpoints|hardpoint]] to a network with sufficient power and sufficient [[Propellant tank|propellant]] in order for them to function. The hardpoint '''must''' be bolted '''directly''' to the frame to be seen as a valid thruster hardpoint.

== Basic information ==

* To be able to fly, a spaceship needs at least one thruster.
** [[Plasma_thruster|Plasma]] Thrusters are the biggest thrusters so far, which can be upgraded to output more thrust. For full thrust they need a warm up time. 
** [[Box_thruster|Box]] and [[Triangle_thruster|triangle]] thrusters are big "main" thrusters and consist of multiple parts that need to be bolted together.
** [[Maneuver_thruster|Maneuver]] thrusters enable small movements of the ship such as adjusting yaw and pitch, though they can still be used as main thrusters on smaller ships.
** Thrusters need to be [[Bolt tool|bolted]] to a [[Hardpoints|hardpoint]] that has access to propellant and electricity.
*** The [[Hardpoints|hardpoint]] has to be [[Bolt tool|bolted]] to the ship's frame with at least two bolts in order for the mounted thruster to properly function or respond to the [[Main flight computer|main flight computer's]] inputs.

* Thrusters need to be in the same [[Data networks|data network]] as both the [[Flight control unit|flight control unit]] and [[Main flight computer|main flight computer]], if they are to be controlled by the main flight computer.

* Thrusters require power to function.
** To get power, a [[Cable tool|cable]] has to be drawn from a power source, such as a [[Generator]] or [[Battery]] to the [[Hardpoints|hardpoint]]'s socket. 

* A thruster also requires [[Propellant tank|propellant]] to function.
** To get propellant, a [[Pipe tool|pipe]] has to be drawn between the device hardpoint and a propellant container.

* Plasma Thrusters will need an additional type of propellant in the future, called Karnite.
** This new fuel will come in the same containers as regular propellant does. 

== Thruster types ==

There are four different thruster types currently available, with all thrusters except the plasma thruster now having three separate variants outlined as tiers one through three:

== Device fields ==

Each of the four thrusters share a set of common device fields (below), but the plasma thruster has additional device fields owing to its unique characteristics.
{|class="wikitable"
! YOLOL field
! description
! range
|-
! '''ThrusterState'''
| Requested output of the thruster
| 0 - 10 000
|-
! '''ThrusterCurrentThrust'''
| Current output of the thruster
| 0 - 10 000
|}

In addition to these, the plasma thruster has two extra fields. 
{|class="wikitable"
! YOLOL field
! description
! range
|-
! '''isactive'''
| 1 = charge ; 0 = discharge
| /
|-
! '''chargelevel'''
| the current charge level of the plasma thruster, must be 1 to produce thrust
| 0 - 1
|}
