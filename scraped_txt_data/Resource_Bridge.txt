The resource port allows the player to connect to, and interact with, the inventory of [[Modular ore cargo crate|ore cargo crates]]. It can also be used to connect a ship to a [[refueling station]] or an [[Ore tower|ore tower]], or even to other ships to allow resource transfer between ships. Resource bridges can not only transfer materials, but also [[electricity]] and [[propellant]].<section end=summary/>

Connection to a resource bridge is necessary to allow transfer of mined materials directly into [[Modular_ore_cargo_crate|cargo crates]].

== Basic information ==

Resource bridges provide access to cargo crates and propellant tanks when they are connected to a pipe network, and [[Battery|batteries]] when they are connected to an electrical network. Players connected to a resource bridge can move inventory to and from cargo crates, allowing them to drop material cubes into the world or transfer them to station storage. Picking up a material cube while connected to a resource bridge will place the material into storage, if possible. Connecting a ship to an ore tower also provides an interface for selling ores or refueling.

== Interaction ==

When interacted with, the resource bridge will show a connection as a glowing yellow strand. The connection will be severed if the player moves too far from the resource port (100 meters).

The resource port allows access to the storage interface for ore cargo crates. Each cargo crate is represented as an inventory slot in the interface in which they are shown.

== Ship-to-ship refueling ==

Ship-to-ship refueling and recharging is possible if two ships are connected via a resource bridge, and both resource bridges are connected to the appropriate networks.
* If the connection detects a propellant tank connected to the donor ship's resource bridge, only propellant transfer will be possible.
* If there is no propellant tank connected to the donor ship's resource bridge, electricity transfer will be possible.

The recipient ship can receive either propellant or power, but not at the same time. Thus, to transfer each resource, the donor ship must have two resource bridges: One with a cable <i>and</i> pipe connection, and one with only a cable connection. To transfer resources, the [[Device fields|device fields]] of the resource bridge(s) on the donor ship must be set as follows:
* '''FlowIn''' is set to 0. '''FlowOut''' is set to 1.

.. while the recipient ship's resource bridge's device fields are set as follows:
* '''FlowIn''' is set to 1. '''FlowOut''' is set to 0.

A single connection can transfer '''50,000''' propellant per second or '''10,000''' electricity per second.
