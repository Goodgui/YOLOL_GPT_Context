The towing beam is a device that can be used to tow other ships.
The towing beam uses power relative to the mass of the ship being towed (5e/s per ton), this mass is also added to the ship's mass, slowing the towing ship, but not adding any stress.
Outside of a safezone any ship can be towed, inside a safezone only un-owned ships are able to be towed.
