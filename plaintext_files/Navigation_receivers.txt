A navigation receiver is a device that can receive signals sent out by Radio transmitters.
Basic information
Have to be pointed to the direction of a transmitter.
They only look for signals in the area they're pointed at. This means that receivers may have to scan areas section by section to find transmitter messages.
If a receiver is in the range of a transmitter and is pointed towards the transmitter, the transmitter's message is set to the receiver's "Message"-field.
Both large and small receivers currently have the same properties.
