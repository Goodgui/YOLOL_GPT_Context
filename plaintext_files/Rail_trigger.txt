Rail triggers are attached to rails and used to control rail network behavior, either through YOLOL or directly by changing configured values.
Rail triggers detect rail movers passing by them.
Basic information
When bolted to a rail, rail triggers will detect rail movers passing by them.
When a mover passes, the rail trigger sets a single variable to either a predetermined value, or a value read from the triggering mover.
