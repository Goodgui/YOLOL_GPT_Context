Function
Device mount
Hardpoints are used for mounting most devices, including thrusters, weapons and tools, and they are available in three common forms: Small, large, and a large corner variant. Apart from the corner variant (which has an additional mounting point for devices), there are no functional differences between the three variants. Hardpoints accept cables and pipes on the socket side, the resources of which are made available to the device that is mounted to them.

Additionally, the large hardpoint and hardpoint corner have separate mounting plates that can (optionally) be used to make mounting them to the beam frame more convenient:
