Gyroscope devices are used to track device rotation over yaw, pitch and roll axes relative to a calibrated 0-pose. Calibrate 0-pose by setting GyroCalibrateId to 1, it will automatically return to 0 after calibration is complete.
Due to the device's construction, roll delta values are limited to a range of [-90,90] and rolling further than that will cause the yaw and pitch values to change.
