Data display
Modular displays are most commonly used in spaceship cockpits as information screens and they are considered vital for easy ship management.
Progress bars are generally configured to show progress from 0 to 100, whereas text panels are generally used to show text.
They can however be used to display whatever information needed.
Basic information
All modular displays need to be connected to a data network and a power source in order for them to work.
Modular displays are designed for displaying information.
The displayable content is set to the
PanelValue
field.
They can be connected to the panel base directly or via another modular device by snapping them together.
Modular devices are: Displays, hybrid buttons and the audio signal device mark 1.
YOLOL can be used to display information, but it is not necessary.

Progress bar memory
Many progress bars can be stacked inside a socket allowing for large amounts of data field storage in a small space. An example .fbe can be found here.
