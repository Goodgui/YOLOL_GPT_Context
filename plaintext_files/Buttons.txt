Function
Toggles device fields
Buttons come in many different shapes, sizes, and colors, but all serve the same purpose: Toggling device field values. While some buttons like the simple button 12×12 or the switch can only toggle between preset values, others can have customized on and off states applied when triggered. This is particularly useful to avoid using YOLOL to interpret button states.
Basic information
Hybrid buttons
are 24×24cm, support custom on/off states, and have a label on their faces that indicate which device field they modify.
Safety lid buttons
are 24×24 cm, and have a physical shield in place over them which must be interacted with before the button can be pressed. These buttons support custom on/off states, and also support coloring via their device fields.
Simple buttons
come in 12×12 cm and 12×24 cm sizes, and support coloring via their device fields.
Warning light buttons
are 12×12 cm, and support custom on/off states, coloring, and a blinking back-light which can be turned on and off.
Switches
are 12×24cm, and output one of three states: -1, 0, 1. They also support coloring via their device fields.
Small buttons
are approximately 30×30×36 cm, and support custom on/off states.
Twist handles
are approximately 24×24×36 cm, and support custom on/off states. These are most typically used to control the flow of propellant tanks.
Configuring a button:
Set the
ButtonState
field name to match the device field you want to control.
Set the On- and Off-state values.
Pressing the button changes its state depending on
ButtonStyle
-field value.
Buttons with the "ButtonColor" field can have a different button color depending on the value of this field.
