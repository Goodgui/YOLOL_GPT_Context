Sub-components
The mining laser applies continuous damage to the first object hit within its configured range, making it an efficient tool in professional mining, and is often used in conjunction with ore collectors.
For example the mining ship Urchin is equipped with mining lasers.
Basic information
Mining laser uses a device field to control the length and state of the laser. 
The mining laser is usually connected to a control device such as buttons or levers.
The mining laser consumes 6000 electricity per second while active.
Assembly
A mining laser needs to be attached to several objects to function:
Utility Tool Body which needs equipped with 2 Utility Tool & Rail Cannon Capacitors
A weapon mount: Either a Turret Cradle, Small Turntable Mount 2, or Fixed Weapon Mount 2 will work
Note that the small turntable mount will require a matching turntable
Device Hardpoint
The hardpoint needs connected to power via Cable or Duct.
