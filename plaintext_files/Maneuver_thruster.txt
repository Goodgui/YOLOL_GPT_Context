Maneuver thrusters are a type of thruster used almost exclusively to provide attitude control to spaceships, allowing them to maneuver. Though they produce relatively little thrust, maneuver thrusters are simple devices with a low profile, which makes them attractive maneuvering options for smaller spacecraft.
Basic information
Unlike other thrusters, maneuver thrusters are single-piece designs, which greatly simplifies their usage. Each maneuver thruster can be addressed individually or as part of a larger group via their device fields, though not as readily as triangle thrusters can. Being cold-gas thrusters, maneuver thrusters are unique in that they have horrible efficiency, produce very little in terms of thrust trails, and have zero light emission while doing so. This can make them a useful option for designers attempting to minimize the visibility of their spacecraft but are not intended as the main drive for larger ships.
