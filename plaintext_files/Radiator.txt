Radiator
Type
Coolant device
Function
Remove heat
Radiators are very effective options for sustained cooling, but often they require heatsinks to reach their full potential. Each section attached extends the radiator's maximum performance without requiring additional mounting slots. Radiators can be used in conjunction with cooling racks, but it is not required.

Basic usage
Radiator Bases can be mounted on hardpoints and Radiator Extensions can be mounted to Radiator Bases or other Extensions.
Radiator Bases have one device interface and two modular output interfaces (where you can connect Radiator Extensions' input interface).
Radiator Extensions have one input (side with colored bolting spots) and one output interface.
Both Bases and Extensions can also be mounted on generators, fuelchambers or heatsinks, but that might be unintended behaviour.
Radiators remove heat transferred to them by heat producers and heatsinks.
Heat is transferred through pipes or connected devices.
Note:
Devices have a limit to how much of their heat they can transfer to radiators (default 75, heatsinks 750 - can be added together). See heat mechanics for in depth info.
