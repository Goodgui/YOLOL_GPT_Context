Function
Houses thruster components
The box thruster body is a device designed to house other components required for the box thruster to function, and to provide convenient mounting points along its hull. Unlike triangle thrusters, the box thruster body has no interfaces to share propellant and power with adjacent thrusters, and each requires its own hardpoint to function.
