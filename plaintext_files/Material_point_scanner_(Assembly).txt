Sub-components
The material point scanner provides information about the materials an object contains.
Basic information
The material scanner casts a ray 100 meters long. If an object is detected within this range, it will update the 'ScanResults', 'Material', and 'Volume' devicefields  If an object contains more than one material, the user can change the 'Index' device field to page through the returned results. These fields will not update until a new object is scanned.
The fields can only be read from a Text Panel if it is written manually by Yolol. Example code execution to manually read and write the results would be:
Material=:SMaterial :Volume=:SVolume goto1
where :Material and :Volume are the names of text panels, and where :SVolume and :SMaterial are the renamed "Volume" and "Material" fields on the Point Scanner. Index must be set to "1" and ScanResults set to 2.
