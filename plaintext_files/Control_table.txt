Modular device interface
Control tables are comprised of a variety of parts, and can be configured to suit a user's needs. They provide a wealth of modular interfaces for control devices (eg: levers, buttons), eliminating the need to cable each individual device and keeping your ship tidy.
Basic information
Unlike traditional wires, control tables provide access to the data network through their flat faces, allowing appropriate devices (eg: hybrid buttons, levers, etc.) to snap and connect to the data network through contact alone. Control tables can also connect to other control tables when they are snapped on top of one another, allowing complex builds to be easily controlled at a single area of a ship or station. A device mounted to a control table shares its access with every other device connected to the control table, enabling users to get creative with how they connect the table to the network at large.
Control tables come in a variety of sizes, but only the
