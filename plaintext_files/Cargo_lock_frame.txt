Cargo-lock frames are a number of devices that can be configured to form a cargo-lock frame assembly, which can be used to transport objects without needing to physically bolt them down. Cargo-lock frames create a stasis field that holds objects within them in place, and can be built to size as needed. For safety reasons, a cargo-lock frame won't activate if there is an endoskeleton inside them, and an active cargo-lock frame is similarly physically inaccessible to an endoskeleton.
