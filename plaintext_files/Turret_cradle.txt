Cradles are device platforms that enable devices mounted to turntables to pitch forward and backwards. They are a pivotal part of any turret system, and can mount many devices such as weapons or tools like the mining laser.
Basic information
A cradle's target rotation can be set with the universal tool, or by connecting it to a control device such as a lever or a button. The cradle's turret rotation device field will rotate the cradle to the specified number in degrees, and does not allow relative adjustments (eg: +5 or -5). Cradles must be mounted to turntables in order to function, as they do not have other interfaces like a hardpoint. The speed at which a cradle rotates is determined by the mass attached to it, and adding too many devices to a cradle will slow it severely. Cradles like the advanced cradle also have provisions for mounting devices to the bases on their outward-facing 'ears'.
