Levers are interactable devices used mainly for controlling devices and machinery. They have many configurable options to allow them to be used in a plethora of ways, and come in two visually identical but functionally distinct forms: A regular lever, and a centering lever. A regular lever (typically) starts at its minimum value, and can be adjusted upwards, while a centering lever starts at a value between its minima and maxima.
Basic information
Uni-directional levers have "zero" in one end and maximum in the opposite end.
Lowering the maximum value lowers the given lever's maximum output to a device.
Bi-directional levers have minimum and maximum in the far ends and the middle/neutral value is 50.
Minimum output has to be lower than the neutral value. Default is 0.
Maximum has to be higher than the neutral value. Default is 100.
