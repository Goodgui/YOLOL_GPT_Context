The panel base provides a convenient way to connect modular devices such as text panels and buttons to the network, which it itself connects to via the socket on the rear side of the device.
Basic information
Like most devices, panel bases provide a bilateral connection to the network that they are connected to: Data that is received on the modular connection is shared with any device connected to the socket, and vice versa. It is worth noting that panel bases provide a proximal connection with their modular side, and some devices such as progress bars do not necessarily need to snapped onto the panel base in order to be 'connected'.
