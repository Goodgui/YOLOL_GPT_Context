The network relay is a device used to separate a network within a ship or station into multiple partially separate sub-networks. Separate sub-networks allow one-way broadcasting of variable changes between them, and enable the creation of modular YOLOL systems.
Basic information
Network Relays are connected to two separate data networks via cable sockets at both ends of the device
One end of the relay acts as the "input" connection
The other end acts as the "output" connection
The input / output direction is shown through triangles pointing towards the output side
When the relay is powered, changes made to device fields connected to the input propagate / will apply to all similarly named device fields that are connected to relay output
Values between networks are not automatically synchronized
This means that connected networks may contain different values for similarly named device fields
A Network Relay can also not propagate data, by setting MasterIsEnabled or IsEnabled to 0
MasterIsEnabled can only be influenced from the Input side
IsEnabled can be influenced from the input side if it is propagating data. If it is 0, it can only be influenced from the Output side.
NOTE:
the Network relay can only function, if there is no open connection between the separate data networks, like a different network relay or a direct cable connection.
Use in conjunction with memory relays to transfer power and select data
