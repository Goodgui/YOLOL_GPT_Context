YOLOL chip socket is a base device, which relays power and connection to a data network for the YOLOL chip. Another option for mounting YOLOL chips is the Modular device rack.
Basic information
Chip sockets have:
Four cable slots
Bolting spots in each corner
Chip sockets are placed to any construct (ship, station or machine) that requires YOLOL to work.
The socket is then bolted to the structure and cabled to a network with power and YOLOL chip's target devices.
Several chip sockets can be placed side by side and they connect to each other without cables.
