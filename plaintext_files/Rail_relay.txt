A rail relay is used to divide a rail network into separate sections with separate sub-networks to enable the creation of modular rail systems. They function similarly to network relays
Basic information
Rail relays connect to a rail network like any other rail piece, but only transmits data in one direction
One end of the relay acts as the "input" connection
The other end acts as the "output" connection
When the relay is powered, changes made to device fields connected to the input propagate will apply to all similarly named device fields that are connected to relay output.
