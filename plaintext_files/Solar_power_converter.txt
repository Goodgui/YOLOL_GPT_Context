Solar power converters are devices used to convert the solar power generated by solar panels into network power, which can be used by other devices or stored in batteries. Power converters contain a small internal battery, but only one may be active on a network at any given time. They are an integral part of a solar panel array, as solar power cannot be used directly from the panel.
