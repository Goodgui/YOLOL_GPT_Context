Sliders
Type
Utility machinery
Function
Sliding motor
Sliders are motors that produce lateral motion. They are functional siblings of hinges.
Basic information
Sliders are most frequently interacted with via a button or YOLOL script, but can also be interacted with directly via the universal tool. They are not especially strong, and cannot be used to mount thrusters to a ship; nor do any of them have provisions to transfer power or propellant beyond the joint itself.

Device fields
YOLOL field
Description
Range
DoorOpenState
Input field for requested door state. 0 is closed, 1 is fully open.
[0,1]
DoorCurrentState
Reports the current position of the door, on the same scale as
DoorOpenState
[0,1]
EndPosition
The rotation/position the joint should be at when
DoorOpenState
is 1. Is measured in percents(%) relative to the maximum possible open state for prismatic joints, and degrees in hinge joints.
[-100,100]
StartPosition
The rotation/position the joint should be at when
DoorOpenState
is 0. Is measured in percents(%) relative to the maximum possible open state for prismatic joints, and degrees in hinge joints.
[-100,100]
TargetVelocity
The maximum velocity the joint will reach. Different joint devices have different velocity limits, and might not be able to reach the configured velocity.
