Converts fuel to power
This page contains information for
individual generator unit parts
, for information on multi-part assembled generators see: Generator (Assembly).
Generators are one of the most important parts of a spaceship, as they convert fuel into electrical energy in an efficient process. They are extremely modular, and can be configured into complexes of many different shapes and sizes - however, for each adjacent generator, the heat output is also increased.
Basic Usage
NOTE!
tier 1 generator parts are not compatible with Tier 2 or 3.
Tier 2 and tier 3 parts are compatible.
Receives
Processed Fuel
from the fuel chamber and converts it to
Power
.
This process also generates
Heat
.
NOTE!
The generators will constantly consume
Processed fuel
, wasting excess
Power
unless their
ConversionRateLimit
is modified via YOLOL.
There are six connectors, one on each side.
Other modules can be attached to the connectors.
Generators produce heat proportional to their unit rate.
For every adjacent generator unit or fuel chamber, extra heat will be generated.
See heat mechanics for more info.
T1 and T2 units produce 1000 units of electricity per second, if enough fuel is available, T3 units can produce 1250 units of electricity per second.
One fuel rod can support three generator units, or 3000 (3750 for T3) units of electricity per second, without enhancement.
An enhanced generator unit will generate more power. See enhancers for more info.
