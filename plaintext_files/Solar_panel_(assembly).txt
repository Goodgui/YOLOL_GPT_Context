An assembled solar panel array, with optional turntable
Solar panel (assembly)
Type
Power device
Function
Converts solar power to network power
Sub-components
Solar panels are complex devices used to generate electricity via the conversion of solar power. They can be assembled in a variety of ways to suit the requirements of the operator, and made to automatically track the sun to maximize their generation potential. Adjacent solar panels and solar panel light sensors are automatically added to the same device network, and do not require individual hardpoints to provide power.
