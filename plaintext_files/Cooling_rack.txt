The cooling rack is a device used to provide a significant reduction in heat via coolant. Unlike a heatsink and radiator system, a coolant rack is not designed for long-term usage, as its coolant is quickly used up during operation and will require replenishing. Thus, some ships use a combination of both systems to cool their generator.
Basic Usage
The cooling board can hold up to three cooling cells.

.
Coolant cells will slowly replenish their supply of fresh coolant over time. However, a coolant recharge rack can be used to expedite this process.
The cooling board can be placed anywhere on a generator, and will provide coolant to each generator of the complex it is directly connected to. Generator complexes connected via pipe will not share coolant.
A single coolant rack can provide up to 5,000 coolant per second (half of the coolant cell's capacity), and can disperse 5 units of heat with 1 unit of coolant. Thus, a coolant rack can disperse up to 25,000 heat per second.
See heat mechanics for more info.
There is only one connector on the cooling board.
