Robot arms are a series of mechanical joints that enable a wide variety of automated tasks, such as ship-building factories and assembly lines. Each segment can be controlled individually through a player's universal tool, or by a device such as a lever, but these movements can also be computed automatically. Robot arms have a special tool-head at their end, which allows a user to equip tools to perform specific tasks. They can also accept a standard hardpoint onto the tool-head, which enables the use of such devices as a rangefinder or any of a variety of weapons.
Basic information
Robot arms consist of two types of joints, revolute and prismatic, which can be stacked together to form articulated arms of varying complexity.
The basic arm configuration has one or two telescoping segments, and an end segment with a revolute joint. More arms or tool holders can be attached to this revolute joint.
The base of any arm combination has to be attached to a special turret base joint.
There are four different sizes of the basic arm.
