The fixed launcher mount, fixed weapon mount 1, and fixed weapon mount 2
Fixed mount
Type
Machinery
Function
Mounts tools and weapons
Machinery that are not required to be mobile (such as tractor beams, mining lasers, and guns) can be attached to a fixed mount for a simple and easy connection. The mount for a weapon or utility is required, as these objects do not have sockets directly mounted to them and require the mount to receive electricity.
