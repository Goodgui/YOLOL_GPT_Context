Fuel chamber
Type
Power device
Function
Provides fuel for generators
Fuel chambers are an integral part of generators, as they convert raw fuel from fuel rods and deliver processed fuel to generator units.
Basic Usage
NOTE!
tier 1 generator parts are not compatible with Tier 2 or 3.
Tier 2 and tier 3 parts are compatible.
Receives
Raw Fuel
from the fuel rod and converts it to
Processed Fuel
.
This process also generates
Heat
.
Distributes
Processed Fuel
to generator units.
There are nine connectors, two on each long side and one on the "back" side of the chamber.
Other modules can be attached to the connectors.
Fuel chambers produce heat proportional to their unit rate.
For every adjacent generator unit or fuel chamber, extra heat will be generated.
See heat mechanics for more info.
T1 fuel chambers require a nhurgite fuel rod, T2 and T3 fuel chambers require an exorium fuel rod.
One fuel rod can support three generator units, or 3000 (3750 for T3) units of electricity per second.
Enhancers have no effect on the fuel chamber.

The formula used for the above tables is 
Fuel_usage = Fuel_Input_(raw) / 3 * Generator_amount
Runtime = FuelChamberMaxFuel / Fuel_usage + GeneratorUnitRateLimit/2
GeneratorUnitRateLimit/2 is due to the spool up of the generator, which at 1/s takes 100 seconds to reach the max of 100, during which the fuel usage is (in sum) halved.
