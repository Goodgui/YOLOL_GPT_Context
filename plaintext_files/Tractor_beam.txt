The tractor beam is a device that projects a ray which can be used to manipulate the object it touches. They can push, pull, and rotate the object in all directions, and are a useful tool for asteroid haulers.

Description
Range
tractorBeamOnState
Beam on/off
1 or 0
tractorBeamSoftRelease
When set to 1, brings the object grabbed by the beam to a stop, then turns off the beam
1 or 0
tractorBeamSnapToObjects
When set to 1, tractor beam tries to snap held object to nearby objects
1 or 0
tractorBeamSearchLength
Length (meters) of the beam when the beam is not attached to anything. Max range of the beam.
0-100
tractorBeamForce
Maximum amount of force the beam will try to apply to grabbed object.
0-50,000
tractorBeamTorque
Maximum amount of torque the beam will try to apply to grabbed object.
0-50,000
tractorBeamPosition
The distance (meters) the beam tries to move a held object to. Resets on grab, but does not message network / other devices.
0-100
tractorBeamYaw
The yaw (degrees) the beam tries to move a held object to, relative to the base. Resets on grab, but does not message network / other devices.
-
tractorBeamPitch
The pitch (degrees) the beam tries to move a held object to, relative to the base. Resets on grab, but does not message network / other devices.
-
tractorBeamRoll
The roll (degrees) the beam tries to move a held object to, relative to the base. Resets on grab, but does not message network / other devices.
-
tractorBeamObjectInBeam
Indicates whether an object is grabbed by the beam.
1 or 0
tractorBeamForceApplied
Indicates the force currently being applied to the grabbed object. Can be used to detect when the grabbed object has been set to the target position.
-
tractorBeamTorqueApplied
Indicates the torque currently being applied to the grabbed object. Can be used to detect when the grabbed object has been set to the target rotation.

Notes
Tractor Beams are relatively weak compared to Cargo Lock Beams. Attempting to pull or push an object whilst moving through space (depending on the objects weight) will cause the object to move according to loose objects in space. This means it is not feasible to pull or push objects on a set trajectory whilst moving using the Tractor Beam.
