The ore collector is a device that efficiently collects mined ore, and is often used in conjunction with the mining laser. They are also used in the tutorial halls at the mining job. A value of 2,000 in the Power field is recommended for 2 or more lasers, with an extra 1,000 per lasers above 4. Alternatively, multiple collectors may be used.
