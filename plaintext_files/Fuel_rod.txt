Fuels generators
Fuel rods provide generators with the exorium fuel that they require to produce power. They have a convenient meter on their face which indicates both the quantity of stored fuel as well as the active drain, if any. They must be snapped into place in a fuel chamber in order to function. Empty fuel rods can be refilled by placing them into inventory and crafting Generator Fuel Rod (Refill).
Tier one (T1) fuel chambers require Nhurgite Fuel Rods, while tier two (T2) and tier three (T3) fuel chambers require Exorium Fuel Rods.
