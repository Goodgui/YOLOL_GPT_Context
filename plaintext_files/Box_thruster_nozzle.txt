Function
Directs thruster force
The box thruster nozzle is a device that directs the force generated by the combustion chamber to produce roughly 20% additional thrust without adding zero extra propellant and electricity cost. Box thrusters do not need nozzles to produce thrust - but it is recommended to have nozzles to increase efficiency per thruster and to protect the combustion chamber in PvP.
