Plasma thruster superconductor
Type
Thruster device
Function
Magnifies thrust force
The plasma thruster superconductors are responsible for the magnification of the thrust force generated by the core. They come in forms with and without struts, and complete superconductor rings (composed of four superconductor parts) can be stacked linearly to add an additional 7,000,000 thrust per ring.
Variants
The superconductor parts come in two variants: One with supporting struts, and one without.
