Cooling cells are devices used in cooling racks to supply a Generator with fresh coolant, which it regenerates passively. The passive regeneration can be improved in a Recharge rack.
Basic Use
Put in a Cooling rack it allows the cooling rack to cool the attached Generator Assembly.
Put in a Coolant recharge rack it regenerates coolant faster at the cost of electricity, but does not contribute to heat removal.
Note
as the coolant cell regenerates coolant by itself you can craft an empty cell, circumventing the Nhurgite cost.
