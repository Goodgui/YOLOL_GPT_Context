Sub-components
The Laser Designator is a device used primarily in combination with torpedos to guide them towards a target.
Basic information
Laser Designators need to hit a target in order for the torpedo laser sensor to update their fields.
The Laser Designator fits into the utility tool body 2 only.
Currently the Laser Designator functions without a power supply.
Connecting the Laser Designator to a power source will randomly reset its active field to 0.
A torpedo linked to a Laser Designator can use the acquired field information to guide itself towards the tip of the laser using YOLOL.
