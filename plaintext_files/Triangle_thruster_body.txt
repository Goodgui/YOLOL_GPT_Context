Function
Houses thruster components
The triangle thruster body is a device designed to house other components required for the triangle thruster to function, and to provide convenient mounting points along its hull. The triangle thruster body is unique in that it also contains three resource ports that can share propellant and electricity with adjacent thrusters, enabling the construction of larger thruster banks that all operate from the same hardpoint. However, when triangle thrusters are assembled this way, they will always act as one thruster, and individual thrusters in the array cannot fire without also firing the rest of the thruster bank.
