Two of the many types of hinges available
Hinges
Type
Utility machinery
Function
Joint motor
Hinges are devices used for creating turning, sliding and opening mechanisms such as doors, hatches and sliding doors.
Basic information
Hinges are most frequently interacted with via a button or YOLOL script, but can also be interacted with directly via the universal tool. They are not especially strong, and cannot be used to mount thrusters to a ship; nor do any of them have provisions to transfer power or propellant beyond the joint itself.

Device fields
YOLOL field
Description
Range
DoorOpenState
Input field for requested door state. 0 is closed, 1 is fully open.
[0,1]
DoorCurrentState
Reports the current position of the door, on the same scale as
DoorOpenState
[0,1]
EndAngle / EndPosition
The rotation/position the joint should be at when
DoorOpenState
is 1. Is measured in percents(%) relative to the maximum possible open state for prismatic joints, and degrees in hinge joints.
StartAngle / StartPosition
The rotation/position the joint should be at when
DoorOpenState
is 0. Is measured in percents(%) relative to the maximum possible open state for prismatic joints, and degrees in hinge joints.
TargetVelocity
The maximum velocity the joint will reach. Different joint devices have different velocity limits, and might not be able to reach the configured velocity.
