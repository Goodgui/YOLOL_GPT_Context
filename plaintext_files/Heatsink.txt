Cooling device
Function
Stores and transfers heat
A heatsink is an integral part to most high-performance power plants, and is used to rapidly store or transfer heat away from generators. Heatsinks also double as Duct.
Usage
Heatsinks facilitate the interaction between devices that produce heat (such as generators, fuel chambers, and mounted weapons) and the devices that can dissipate heat (such as radiators). Heatsinks can be used to effectively bypass the transfer limitation for heat that exists between devices and radiators, as their thermal transfer limitation is significantly higher. Despite their significant visual differences, each heatsink style has the same effective mass and thermal properties.
