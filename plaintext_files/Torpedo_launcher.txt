Basic Usage
The entire tube must first be mounted to gain access to the device fields, and only the end part provides access to the device fields required to operate the torpedo tube.
A torpedo must be snapped inside the torpedo launcher
The torpedo tube should have its 'LauncherLock' device field toggled to '1' in order to lock the torpedo in place
The 'launchTorpedo' field should be toggled to '1' to fire the torpedo
Device Fields
These device fields are located only on the end component of the launcher tube.
