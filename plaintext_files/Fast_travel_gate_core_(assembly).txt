Sub-components
The fast travel gate core is a complex device that allows passage through warp gates. Though it requires no input power, it must be securely mounted to the ship with each part accounted for and in good condition in order for a ship to be able to use the warp gate.
NOTE:
The Fast Travel Gate Core is no longer required for using the Fast Travel Gate and can no longer be crafted.
Assembly
Each gate core requires the following sub-components to be properly assembled:
2x supports
2x outer bodies
2x inner bodies
1x core
These sub-components must be bolted together, but do not require any other input. The core of the device has one device field
TravelCoreAssembled
which indicates if the device is currently capable of warp gate travel.
