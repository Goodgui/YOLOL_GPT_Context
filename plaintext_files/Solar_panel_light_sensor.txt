Solar panel light sensors are devices used to orientate solar panels to follow the position of the sun in order to maximize power generation. Though the light sensor incorporates a section of photovoltaic cells, the maximum power output of the solar panel light sensor is significantly less than regular solar panels.
Adjacent solar panels and solar panel light sensors are automatically added to the same device network, and do not require individual hardpoints to provide power.
