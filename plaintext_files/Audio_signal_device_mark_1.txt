The audio signal device is used to add audio feedback to spaceships and station devices. They support a plethora of options to customize the playback of audio, and can be wired to directly via their sockets or via a modular interface on their backside.
Basic Usage
You must first match the
InputValue
device field name to another device field name that you want to use to trigger playback. The
TriggerValue
and
TriggerRule
device fields are used to determine when the change in the
InputValue
field will trigger audio playback.
TriggerRule
accepts one of three values (-1, 0, 1), which are equivalent to the comparison operators lesser-than, equal-to, and greater-than respectively.
