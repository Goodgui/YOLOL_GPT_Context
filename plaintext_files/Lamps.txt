Function
Provides light
Lamps are light-emitting devices, used to illuminate stations, spaceships, and other installations as needed. They are more useful as general area lighting than as spotlights, as their range is particularly limited.
Basic information
A lamp's color can be customized by replacing the bulb in the lamp with one of another color.
Lamps can also be used as a part of a network to signal data transfers for example.
Power consumption when turned on: 0.125 electricity per second.
Please note that visible light reach on the bulb is not accurate - the bulb glowing is visible from that distance, rather than the light being able to illuminate objects at that distance.
For example, Lamp type A cannot
illuminate
objects at 10 metres, rather the glow will just be visible
from
10 metres away. The visual effect of the bulb being on or off (it's just a brighter shade of the off bulb) can be viewed from any distance away, assuming that it's within render distance.
