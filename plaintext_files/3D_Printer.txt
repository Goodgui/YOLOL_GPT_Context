Small 3D Printer
The small 3D printer is a smaller, but slower version of the large printer. It has an integrated utility
      box and can accept it's own fuel rod, or use power
      provided from other sources
3D Printer
The large 3D printer requires a Utility box to connect to a station's power grid and to access the station
      inventory for material and to output complete parts.
How to use
Small 3D Printer
Insert fuel rod into the printer
Insert the blueprint chip
You can buy these from the Marketplace.
Turn on the printer
Change UtilityConnection field to 1, this is required to allow printer to put finished items into
            station storage.
Change PrinterControl field to 1 and make sure PrinterOrderAmount is above 0 (should be 1 by
            default).
Printer requires access to the building materials for each piece (through station storage or
            connected ore crates)
3D Printer
Prepare the printer
Requires a lot of power, it's recommended to use a Utility box and to purchase electricity to the
            station storage.
Radiators must be used to cool the printer, one printer needs approximately 17 radiators.
Printer needs to be connected to a storage. Use pipe connection with a Utility box.
Insert a blueprint chip
Turn on the printer
Change PrinterControl field to 1.
Printer requires access to the building materials for each piece (through station storage or
            connected ore crates)

PrinterOrderAmount
Used to select the number of times full blueprint is printed. Decrements by 1 every time the final
            item on the blueprint is completed unless already at or below 0,
printer repeats from the first piece of not 0. -1 repeats printing indefinitely.
